    <h1>About Click with Care</h1>
    <p>
      Click with Care is a youth-driven website created as part of a CEP project, aiming to help society rethink the way we use mobile phones. 
      With growing concerns about digital addiction and misuse, this project encourages balanced, mindful, and conscious use of technology 
      — especially among youth. By exploring the advantages, disadvantages, and practical tips, users can become more aware of their digital habits.
    </p>
    <h2>Why this matters</h2>
    <p>
      In today’s hyper-connected world, smartphones have become both a necessity and a source of distraction. 
      Our mission is to inspire people to use their phones responsibly, recognizing both their power and their pitfalls.
